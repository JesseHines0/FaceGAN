This is the code for my AI Generative Adversarial Network project.

The project is written in python 3.7.5

see the sample_images folder to see images generated by the models at various epochs.
Note: in the sample image file names the epoch count restarts between training sessions even when the model hasn't been reset.

To generate images run demo.py to generate and display images created by the model.

GAN.py contains the code for the actual model.

Most the rest of the code files are related to downloading and preprocessing the data.

Dependencies (installed with pip):
    tensorflow
    numpy
    matplotlib
